DOMAIN : SQL

DURATION : 4 WEEKS

MENTOR : NEELA SANTHOSH KUMAR

DESCRIPTION :
The objective of this task is to demonstrate advanced data analysis skills using SQL. The task involves writing complex queries using Window Functions, Subqueries, and Common Table Expressions (CTEs) to analyze trends, patterns, and insights from the dataset. This task is a part of the CodTech internship program and aims to simulate real-world data reporting scenarios.

Tools and Techniques Used:

Window Functions: Used to compute running totals, ranks within groups, and more without collapsing the rows.

Subqueries: Used for filtering and comparing aggregated results.

CTEs (Common Table Expressions): Used for creating temporary result sets to simplify and modularize complex queries.

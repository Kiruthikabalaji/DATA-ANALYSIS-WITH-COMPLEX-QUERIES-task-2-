1. Trend Analysis: Monthly Sales:

SELECT 
  DATE_TRUNC('month', order_date) AS month,
  SUM(amount) AS total_sales
FROM sales_data
GROUP BY DATE_TRUNC('month', order_date)
ORDER BY month;

2.Window Function: Running Total:

SELECT 
  order_date,
  customer_id,
  amount,
  SUM(amount) OVER (ORDER BY order_date) AS running_total
FROM sales_data;

3. Rank Customers by Sales in Each Region:

SELECT 
  customer_id,
  region,
  SUM(amount) AS total_sales,
  RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY region ORDER BY SUM(amount) DESC) AS rank_in_region
FROM sales_data
GROUP BY customer_id, region;

4. Subquery: Customers Above Average Spending:

SELECT * FROM sales_data
WHERE customer_id IN (
  SELECT customer_id
  FROM sales_data
  GROUP BY customer_id
  HAVING AVG(amount) > (
    SELECT AVG(amount) FROM sales_data
  )
);

5. CTE: Combine with Product Info (Assume products table):

WITH customer_spending AS (
  SELECT 
    customer_id,
    SUM(amount) AS total_spent
  FROM sales_data
  GROUP BY customer_id
)
SELECT cs.customer_id, cs.total_spent, c.name
FROM customer_spending cs
JOIN customers c ON cs.customer_id = c.id;
